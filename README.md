# Paste To MySQL

Paste CSV / Other separated data to the browser and insert it to a MySQL table. Useful for pasting data from MS Access. (I am tired of one by one copy and pasting values from Access to phpmyadmin)

## Installation

Copy files to web root. Create a new mysql user with ALL privileges. Modify includes/config.php. DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE IN PRODUCTION, SINCE IT IS NOT SECURE.
